# rabbit-labs-flipper-animation
A Flipper animation for Rabbit-Labs

Install by placing the entire `RabbitLabs_Anim1_128x64` folder in `ext/dolphin/` and adding an entry for it to your `manifest.txt` file.

For the `manifest.txt` file I recommend appending the following code:

```
Name: RabbitLabs_Anim1_128x64
Min butthurt: 0
Max butthurt: 13
Min level: 1
Max level: 30
Weight: 5
```
